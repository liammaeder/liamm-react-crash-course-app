# liamm-react-crash-course-app
A simple web app that I created with the React crash course by Mosh on his youtube. I will be building on this at a later point with native react in another repo.

This app will be an online shopping app, populated with dumby data. 
It will allow you to log into a profile, browse items, list items, message the seller and purchase the items.
